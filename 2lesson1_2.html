        <h3 class="c1"><strong>Color Theory</strong> is the art and science of creating the right palette for your website. This is very important as it sets the whole mood for your entire website.</h3>
    
        <p>As we all know, color theory can change the way our perspective is on certain objects. Observe;</p>

        </div>
    
        <p>Using the blues and purple, this creates a dark atmosphere if we were to use this palette. There's nothing wrong with using any sort of palette so long as it can compliment each other well!</p>

        <h3 class="t1"><strong>Typography</strong> is the art and technique of arranging type to make written language legible, readable and appealing when displayed.</h3>

        <p class="John4">Hello! My name is John, what's yours?</p>
    
        <p>See! These are easy to read, and quite simplistic. Lets try another font.</p>
    
        <h2>Figure 2:</h2>

        <p class="John6">Hello! My name is John, what's yours?</p>
